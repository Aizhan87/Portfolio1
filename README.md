# Portfolio1

Hi, my name is Aizhan. Currently, I am a student at UCLA full-stack coding bootcamp located in Los Angeles, CA. This course teaches us languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Responsive Design, Node.js, React.js, Heroku, User Authentication, MongoDB, MySQL, PHP frameworks like Laravel, and more. We are almost at the end of the program and I feel very confident in the mastery of the subjects that we've learned so far. This program is encouraging us to work in the groups that help us develop self-efficacy for when we are ready to be exposed to real world development. 

I created this portfolio from scratch with help of materializecss documentation. In this portfolio you will find all the information about my projects, education, experience, and contact information. Hope you'll like the layout of my page.
